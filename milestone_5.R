# I loaded a dataset from the Urban Institute that shows tract-level economic
# and demographic information for all Qualified Opportunity Zones. I believe
# these data were last updated on 12/14/2018.
# To clean up the categorization of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical
# Areas, I created a new column that will be easy to transfer into a shiny app.
# The suburbrur column helps us see the urbanization of the region. Later in the
# project, I might bring in 538's urbanization index to be able to view these
# census tracts on a continuous urbanization scale, rather than broad categories
# like this.

# Below is the User Interface. I meant to create a dropdown where you can choose
# between Urban, Suburban, or Rural opportunity zones. The output (in server)
# should show average unemployment, home ownership, and poverty by southern
# state for the type of zone selected.
